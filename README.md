 # KEY NOTE : 
  1. The cool thing about the project is here I am using java script ES6 techniques.
      This is a modern style of usue java script in your code, it makes your code much more easier to understand and give you the proper knowledge of 
       # function, event, arrow notation in Java Script  
  2.  For Development And Experience I would suggest You to use Inspector / F12 & understand how the paragraphs are added and
      # see the difference when we put blank space in input field.
